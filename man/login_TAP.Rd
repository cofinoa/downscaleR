\description{
Provides HTTP authentication for accessing the Santander Met Group's THREDDS Data Server
}
\details{
The Santander Met Group has deployed a THREDDS Data Server to enable access to different climate databases/data collections,
implementing a fine-grained user authorization and using remote data access protocols with data subsetting capabilities.
Prior to data access, users must log in. Registration can be obtained via the THREDDS Administration Panel (\href{http://www.meteo.unican.es/tap}{TAP}),
 indicating the group (Project) you belong to (e.g. CORDEX, SPECS ...), which will grant access to certain databases.
 Further details on registration for data access can be viewed in this \href{http://meteo.unican.es/ecoms-udg/DataServer/Registration}{example link}.
}
\note{
For the users of the ECOMS User Data Gateway via the \pkg{ecomsUDG.Raccess} package it is not necessary
to do the login via this function, as authorization is previously obtained via the \code{\link[ecomsUDG.Raccess]{loginECOMS_UDG}}
 interface.
