\usage{
ppModelSetup(obs, pred, sim)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{A field or station data containing the observed climate data for the training period}

\item{pred}{A field containing the simulated climate by the model for the training period. This can be either
the same variable as \code{obs}, in the case of model calibration (bias correction and related techniques) or MOS (model
 output statistics) approaches, or a set of predictors in the case of \emph{perfect prog} downscaling approaches (possibly
 after principal component analysis via the \code{\link{prinComp}} output).}

\item{sim}{A field containing the simulated climate for the variables used in \code{pred}, but considering the test period.}
}
\value{
A list with differet components required by the downscaling functions:
\itemize{
\item \code{stations} Logical indicating whether the predictand comes from station data
\item \code{multi.member} Logical indicating whether the simulation data is multi-member or not
#\item \code{obs} Same as input parameter of the same name
\item \code{pred.mat} 2D matrix of predictors. Predictors are arranged in columns and time in rows
\item \code{sim.mat} A list of 2D matrices containing the prediction data. The list is of length \emph{n},
being \emph{n} the number of members considered (n = 1 for deterministic/single member predictions).
\item \code{sim.dates} The Dates element of the simulation data (either a list of start/end lists for
several predictors or a list of two with the estart/end of a single predictor. See \code{\link{dateReplacement}}
for details).
}
}
\description{
Performs the various data pre-processing and formatting steps required
to implement the different perfect-prog downscaling methods.
}
\details{
The function accepts either PCA or raw fields as predictors. In the first case, it handles the
mapping of EOFs onto the simulation fields.
